Mount an SD card image
=====================

This has been tested using the SD card generated by installing raspbian (for raspberry pi) and transfering that image to an Ubuntu desktop system.

First, copy the contents of an SD card to your harddrive:

```
dd if=/dev/sdx of=my_sd_card_image.bin bs=512
```
Where "sdx" is replaced with the device name of your SD card reader, mine is "sdc".

Now you have a file named my_sd_card_image.bin that has the contents of your SD card.

Now the easy part:

```
./mount_sd_image.pl my_sd_card_image.bin
```

This will give you the command, with a sudo at the beginning. You can either copy/paste and run it yourself, or run the previous command with sudo:

```
sudo ./mount_sd_image.pl my_sd_card_image.bin
```

This will create a directory alongside your image file, with "_live" added to the end of the name, and mount the ext3 partition in the image there.
